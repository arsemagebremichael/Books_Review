                            <p> Local community: Systemic inequality still persists in African communities. In Ethiopia,
                                certain nationalities are privileged to jobs and others not so. In Kenya, white and
                                indians
                                have access to certain things and others not because of the color of their skin. And In
                                South Africa, apartheid’s legacy remains visible in persistent racial inequalities,
                                spatial
                                segregation, and limited access to resources for Black communities. Decades after
                                apartheid’s end, Black South Africans continue to face systemic barriers in education,
                                employment, and housing, with many still living in under-resourced townships far from
                                economic centers.
                                The trauma and socioeconomic disadvantages inflicted by apartheid have been transmitted
                                across generations, shaping attitudes, opportunities, and even psychological well-being.

                                consequences of institutionalized racism such as the United States’ history of
                                segregation,
                                Australia’s treatment of Indigenous peoples, and caste-based discrimination in South
                                Asia.
                                These contexts reveal how legal and social systems can establish inequality long after
                                discriminatory laws are reversed.
                                Apartheid’s legacy is seen in the continued fight against racism, the demand for
                                compensation , and the frameworks established to protect human rights. It remains a

                                segregation, and limited access to resources for Black communities. Decades after
                                apartheid’s end, Black South Africans continue to face systemic barriers in education,
                                employment, and housing, with many still living in under-resourced townships far from
                                economic centers.
                                The trauma and socioeconomic disadvantages inflicted by apartheid have been transmitted
                                across generations, shaping attitudes, opportunities, and even psychological well-being.

                <p> Local community: Systemic inequality still persists in African communities. In Ethiopia,
                    certain nationalities are privileged to jobs and others not so. In Kenya, white and indians
