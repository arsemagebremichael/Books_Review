                        <h2>Legacy of Apartheid: Systemic Inequality</h2>
                        <div class="theme-content">
                            <p>
                                Apartheid’s effect still linger in Trevor’s mother, Patricia and Trevor was not able to
                                be
                                in his father’s life for over a decade. </p>
                            <p> Local community: Systemic inequality still persists in African communities. In Ethiopia,
                                certain nationalities are privileged to jobs and others not so. In Kenya, white and
                                indians
                                have access to certain things and others not because of the color of their skin. And In
                                South Africa, apartheid’s legacy remains visible in persistent racial inequalities,
                                spatial
                                segregation, and limited access to resources for Black communities. Decades after
                                apartheid’s end, Black South Africans continue to face systemic barriers in education,
                                employment, and housing, with many still living in under-resourced townships far from
                                economic centers.
                                The trauma and socioeconomic disadvantages inflicted by apartheid have been transmitted
                                across generations, shaping attitudes, opportunities, and even psychological well-being.
                            </p>
                            <p> Global context: the legacy of apartheid resonates with other societies struggling with
                                the
                                consequences of institutionalized racism such as the United States’ history of
                                segregation,
                                Australia’s treatment of Indigenous peoples, and caste-based discrimination in South
                                Asia.
                                These contexts reveal how legal and social systems can establish inequality long after
                                discriminatory laws are reversed.
                                Apartheid’s legacy is seen in the continued fight against racism, the demand for
                                compensation , and the frameworks established to protect human rights. It remains a
                                warning,
                                a lesson, and a reuniting point for those seeking justice and equality in every society.

                                Faith and religion were key tools that acted as guiding forces in Patricia’s life.
                                They serve as a great source of comfort and significance for Trevor’s mother, women in
                                Soweto,
                                and, as he says, many other individuals in the world.” In Soweto ,religion filled the
                                void left by absent men.” pg39.
                                It enables them to maintain hope amid struggles and oppression while also allowing them
                                to progress during the colonial era.
                                Trevor's mother is a devoted Christian who takes her family to three different churches
                                every Sunday, spending the entire day there,
                                and seems to believe that the more she attends church, the greater her blessings will be
                                and the higher the likelihood that her prayers will be answered.
                                Trevor was not in support of this idea of you have to go to three churches for God to
                                answer your prayers well.
                            </p>
                            <p>In conclusion, Patricia fervently prays when Abel attempts to kill her, and his gun
                                inexplicably misfires four times,
                                an event that the police are unable to comprehend or explain. While it appears that
                                Patricia's prayers are safeguarding her life,
                                Noah also questions why his mother has to endure such immense suffering despite her
                                devoutness. Additionally, Noah's extended family in
                                Soweto values his involvement in prayer circles because he speaks English,whenever he
                                prayed his grandmother would say ”That prayer is going to be answered.
                                I can feel it” and there is a belief that "everyone knows" God is more attentive to
                                prayers offered in English. This highlights both the family's hopefulness
                                regarding their futures and the advantages they perceive from selectively mimicking the
                                colonizers who introduced Christianity to South Africa in the first place.

                                Trevor Noah’s ability to speak different languages like Xhosa, English, Afrikaans ,
                                Zulu and others , made him connect with a wide range of people that were divided by
                                apartheid. He used these
                                languages to bridge cultural, tribal and racial divisions and helped him navigate
                                through situations that were difficult.
                                Trevor’s mother Patricia taught him that “language , even more than color , defines who
                                you are to people.” This shows how he
                                used language to find a sense of belonging in different communities.


                            </p>
                            <p>For example, in chapter 4, when Trevor was at H.A. Jack Primary, he struggles with his
                                light skin color,
                                which affects his place in the various groups in the school. His ability to speak
                                multiple languages allowed him to
                                feel more at home with his black peers than his white classmates. The power of language
                                is also seen in Chapter 17.
                                When he spoke to a fellow prisoner in their native language, Tsonga, he discovered a
                                shared humanity that is beyond their
                                appearance, showing how language can break barriers and build bridges. “ Language brings
                                with it identity and a culture, or at
                                least the perception of it. A shared language says we are the same. A language barrier
                                says “We are different”
                                ”Trevor’s relating to Nelson Mandela’s famous quote, “ If you talk to a man in a
                                language
                                that he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his , that goes to his
                                heart,” emphasise the power of language to create genuine connections.

                                Noah’s identity as a mixed child in South African Apartheid. He was recognized/perceived
                                as an outsider.
                                Neither fully black nor fully white. This meant that in both races, he never belonged in
                                any.
                                He and other mixed South Africans were labeled as “colored”. The Apartheid laws also
                                prevented him from openly declaring a relationship with his parents.
                                Trevor and his mother were forced to hide their relationship to avoid trouble with the
                                authorities. For example chapter 6
                                Trevor’s mother denies being his mother in the shop since she was black and Trevor was
                                colored. Amidst all these challenges, Patricia’s faith,
                                combined with her ability to find humor and hope even in the hard struggles they were
                                going through, was a defining characteristic of their relationship.
                                For example, after the harrowing experience on the minibus with the two Zulu men,
                                Patricia credited their survival to God’s intervention, emphasizing the importance of
                                faith in their lives.
                                Church attendance and the religious gatherings provided Trevor with a sense of community
                                and belonging.


                            </p>
                            <p> Despite all the struggles Trevor went through in finding belongingness, his ability to
                                speak many languages helped him find belonging
                                in different communities. For example, he finds a sense of connection and support within
                                the “cheese boys”, a group of mixed young men.
                                Trevor’s navigation in different identities and finding belonging shows that it is
                                possible to bridge different groups, showing that
                                “ belonging is a choice and can be cultivated through self-definition rather than being
                                imposed by circumstances.”

                                The book reveals how patriarchal systems shape the society
                                we live in,family structures , gender relations,culture,religion
                                and even the legal systems.
                                In many of the black south african communities Trevor sees how women are supposed to be
                                obedient
                                and submissive. Patricia’s relationship with Abel is a perfect example of
                                patriarchy.Abel is threatened by her confidence and independence ,leading to him being
                                violent.This violence depicts how some men in the society use force to maintain control
                                when their women challenge the traditional structures of power.
                                Patriarchy in legal systems is also shown in the story,when Abel constantly abuse his
                                wife and the police do nothing,instead they laugh it off with him.The police would
                                actually suggest that marriage cases should be handled privately.Even when Patricia is
                                shot by Abel,the system still failed to punish him.

                    Apartheid’s effect still linger in Trevor’s mother, Patricia and Trevor was not able to be
                    in his father’s life for over a decade. </p>
                <p> Local community: Systemic inequality still persists in African communities. In Ethiopia,
                    certain nationalities are privileged to jobs and others not so. In Kenya, white and indians
                    have access to certain things and others not because of the color of their skin. And In
                    South Africa, apartheid’s legacy remains visible in persistent racial inequalities, spatial
                    segregation, and limited access to resources for Black communities. Decades after
                    apartheid’s end, Black South Africans continue to face systemic barriers in education,
                    employment, and housing, with many still living in under-resourced townships far from
                    economic centers.
                    The trauma and socioeconomic disadvantages inflicted by apartheid have been transmitted
                    across generations, shaping attitudes, opportunities, and even psychological well-being.
                </p>
                <p> Global context: the legacy of apartheid resonates with other societies struggling with the
                    consequences of institutionalized racism such as the United States’ history of segregation,
                    Australia’s treatment of Indigenous peoples, and caste-based discrimination in South Asia.
                    These contexts reveal how legal and social systems can establish inequality long after
                    discriminatory laws are reversed.
                    Apartheid’s legacy is seen in the continued fight against racism, the demand for
                    compensation , and the frameworks established to protect human rights. It remains a warning,
                    a lesson, and a reuniting point for those seeking justice and equality in every society.

                                Trevor Noah’s entire life is shaped by the fact that he was different — a mixed-race

                                challenge, hardship, and even moment of joy came at a cost because he didn’t fit into
                                any one group.
