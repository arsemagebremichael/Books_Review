            <h2>Color Blind: Not confied by it</h2>
            <p>Trevor Noah's book has opened my eyes to how apartheid was and continues to exist though its legacy
                across South Africa. I chose the title "Color Blind: Not confined by it" to express the resilience and
                motivation of Trevor to go beyond what was "set" by the world for him even before he came to earth. The
                title I chose also reflects Patricia's resilience on gender-based generational trauma, her not
                submitting to limited patriarchal norms. It contains their shared determination to go beyond the
                barriers set by a society before they were even born.</p>

            <h3>Reflective blog</h3>
            <div class="excerpt">

                <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-2xl"></i>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a
                    traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman
                    who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-2xl"></i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class='reflections'>

                There is a saying that goes, "Human desires often only become clear when encountered the opposite of
                what we are looking for." Unfortunately for Patricia, Abel's pursuit of "fire", a woman of ambition,
                goals and that goes beyond the norms masked his actual desire for "water", a traditional woman who
                follows gender roles, that is submissive to her husband. This narrative opens our eyes to a broader
                societal tension on gender inequalities and gender roles, a dynamic that still exists across cultures
                even in progressive societies where men supposedly identify as "woke", "civilized", or "feminist".
                Beneath these labels, a persistent need for male superiority is observed revealing the contradiction
                stated above.
                Societal expectations put a heavy blanket of burden on women, demanding them to exceed the men in work
                place just to earn "respect", and equal treatment, and as if this is not enough, woman simultaneously
                are expected to manage the household responsibilities of maintaining the household, raising children,
                catering to her husband's needs and expect her to still have time to care for herself. On the contrary,
                men often get praised for minimum effort such as putting the dishes away, which society frames as
                "helping his wife" rather than sharing responsibilities. This basically reflects the double standard we
                as a society share towards women. </p>
            <p class='reflections'>
                Freud's concept of "penis envy", a metaphor suggests women envy men "societal freedom." This addresses
                the inequalities on gender roles and it requires getting rid of our norms and bringing a culture in
                which both share responsibilities and are accountable. Only through a continuous effort can societies
                across cultures move more towards an actual gender equity, challenging the imposed structure of women
                and men gender role gaps.
