                <h2>Yaa Gyasi</h2>
                <p>"Gyasi's characters are so fully realized, so elegantly carved-very often I found myself longing to
                    hear more. Craft is essential given the task
                    Gyasi sets for herself-drawing not just a lineage of two sisters, but two related peoples. Gyasi is
                    deeply concerned with the sin of selling
                    humans on Africans, not Europeans. But she does not scold. She does follows are not overly virtous
                    victims. Sin comes in all forms, from
                    selling people to abandoning children. I think i needed to rememberwhat happens when you pair a
                    gifted literacy mind to an epic task.

                <p>TREVOR NOAH was BORN A CRIME - not because he could answer back in five languages; not because his
                    mother threw
                    him out of the window of a moving car; not because he accidentally burnt down someone's house with a
                    magnifying
                    glass; not even because he took Hitler to a bar mitzah but because this was this was South Africa
                    and his mother
                    was black and his father was white. "Noah has a real story to tell. A little
                    scary, but trust me - it's funny"<i>NEWSDAY</i>"</p>

                <h2>Dr Spencer Johnson</h2>
                <p>"In the beginning all 4 characters are mostly equally focused on finding their cheese but once they
                    get a taste of it, things start to change. Keep in mind, the cheese is just a metaphor for your
                    goals, what makes you happy and what you want in life.

                    Little people, as similar to humans as they are, start to over-relax, getting too comfortable,
                    considering the cheese as theirs, as they deserved it, they owned it and only the greatest injustice
                    in the world would take it for them. Certainly, this can’t happen, right?"

                <h1>The Alchemist</h1>
                <h2>Paulo Coelho</h2>
                <p>"Combining magic, mysticism, wisdom, and wonder into an inspiring tale of self-discovery, The
                    Alchemist has become a modern classic, selling millions of copies around the world and transforming
                    the lives of countless readers across generations.

                    Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who
                    yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far
                    different—and far more satisfying—than he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the
                    essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens
                    strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, following our dreams."

                <p>"In The Four Agreements, don Miguel Ruiz reveals the source of self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering. Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, the Four Agreements offer a powerful code of conduct that can rapidly transform our lives to a new experience of freedom, true happiness, and love. The Four Agreements are: Be Impeccable With Your Word, Don't Take Anything Personally, Don't Make Assumptions, Always Do Your Best."
