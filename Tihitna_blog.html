            <h2>Forbidden Identity</h2>
            <p>In my opinion if I asked to change the title of born a crime book i will call it as “Forbidden Identity”
                because THis title can express the an iddentity that isn't<br> allowed or accepted in the society due to
                cultural,political<br> and also caltural reasons and also this phrase can express the struggle to live
                in
                forbidden environment,addvocating for inclusivness and acceptance in that environment.</p>

            <h3>Reflective blog</h3>
            <div class="excerpt">

                <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left fa-2xl"></i>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a
                    traditional wife… but he never fell in love with subservient women… 'He only wants a woman
                    who is free because his dream is to put her in a cage.<i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right fa-2xl"></i>
                </p>
            </div>
            <p class='reflections'>"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife...but he never fell in
                love with subservilent women...He only wants a woman who is free bcause his dream is to put her in a
                cage."" This quote in Traver noah born a crime book shows Abel wanted a woman who he can control but he
                got a true opposite of he wanted because Patricia was a woman used to doing what she wanted she was
                independent and confident about what she does.
                The quote can be related to gender roles in today's sociaity while many women are still responsible for
                specific roles especially in home responsiblities while men may have the responsibility to be the
                provider and control a dominant position. The pressure can create tention in relationships for example,
                If we see some ethiopian men might desire tradition girl valuing family ,respect and religion however
                attracted to a modern girl’s independent and confidence.This causes dissatisfaction and misunderstanding
                in the relationship because of the opposite desires according to tradition woman desire for social
                acceptance and also personal desire in modern woman.
                Abel’s desire toward Patricia shows that people are attracted to strong personalities.A woman who knows
                her choice,standard and a woman who has confidence,who believes in herself is attractive in nature,
                because people are attracted to people who believe in themselves.
                The reason that abel wants a woman who is traditional was due to his dream to put her in a cage this can
                show sexism insights naw a day marige maight prevent for womens’ growth even if there is no control of
                men over women.Domestic responsibilities and attitude can prevent womens growth we can see points such
                as learning after marriage ,and also giving birth.because of social expectation,child care burden,carrer
                interruption because of giving birth this all causes low development of women after marriage.so that it
                is not bad if we call it hidden cage.
