                        <h2>Slavery, racism and systemic oppression </h2>
                        <div class="theme-content">
                            <h3>Review of core issue:</h3>
                            <p>Slavery is a central theme in the book. The book explores the complicity of Africans in
                                enabling slavery, slavery perpetuated by the colonial masters, and the institutionalised
                                racism and oppression in our society today.</p>
                            <p>The book traces the lineages of two sisters who are sold into slavery: Effia and Esi, the
                                former through marriage and the latter as a prisoner of war. </p>
                            <p>Effia lives in the governor's castle, and below the castle, slaves are trapped in the
                                dungeon awaiting shipment to America. Her husband, the governor, never talks about the
                                slaves who look like his wife, and Effia feigns ignorance. In this context, she was an
                                enabler as she chose not to want to know what was happening in her own compound.
                            </p>
                            <p> Chief Abeeku conducted trade with the British, dealing in slaves. This goes to show the
                                complicity of Africans in the slave trade that resulted in death, suffering, and the
                                separation of families.
                            </p>
                            <p>Esi’s daughter, Ness, worked as a slave in a cotton field in Mississippi, where she
                                compared her stay there as “In hell, the sun scorched cotton, it almost burned the palm
                                of your hands to touch it”(page 74). She describes her master at the farm as “the
                                Devil”. This depiction emphasizes the suffering brought about by slavery. </p>
                            <p> H was imprisoned for nine years for “studyin’ a white woman” (page 158) and he is leased
                                to work in a coal mine, while working out his sentence. At the mine, he is in constant
                                fear of death and endures brutal beatings.</p>
                            <h3>How does the issue resonate with current societal themes? </h3>
                            <p> In today’s society, systemic racism and subtle forms of slavery have persisted. In
                                Kenya, thousands of young people are recruited to go and work each year in the Gulf
                                countries, where they are treated like second-class human beings. They are denied basic
                                rights and freedoms, forced by their economic situations to endure subtle slavery just
                                to eke a living.
                            </p>
                            <p> In the United States, the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man at the hands of a
                                white police officer, is one example of the systemic racism that has persisted since the
                                seventeenth century to date.</p>

                                Characters across generations struggle to understand where they come from, often feeling
                                the loss of heritage due to slavery, colonization, and migration.

                            <p> The black stone pendant passed down through Effia’s lineage
                                symbolizes this longing for connection to one’s roots.
                            </p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>In today’s globalized world, many people, especially those in diasporic communities,
                                struggle to connect with their roots and cultural identities. The novel’s focus on
                                knowing one’s heritage mirrors contemporary movements like DNA ancestry testing,
                                cultural revitalization projects, and the push for more inclusive histories in
                                education. </p>

                        <div class="theme-content">
                            <h3> “It was the first time she realized
                                that love and loss were two sides of the same coin.”
                            </h3>
                            <p>The book Homegoing is deeply rooted in different traces. Love and loss are also the
                                backbone of the story, which appears in different forms across the generations, states,
                                and time. Love often exists in romantic and familiar ways.
                            </p>
                            <p>Family love in the novel is often marked by separation. Effia and Esi, two half-sisters
                                who never meet, represent the original fracture. Effia remains in Ghana, married into
                                the colonizer's household, while Esi is sold into slavery, taken to America. This divide
                                shows how familial bonds are tested by forces far beyond their control. Motherhood is
                                also defined by both grief and love. Esi loses her child before she can know them.
                                Akua’s generational trauma destroyed her family.
                            </p>
                            <p> In terms of romantic relationships, we can see Effiyas with her white husband Jems,
                                Marjorie and Marcus, Kojo, the child of Ness and Sam's romantic relationship with Anna.
                                Kojo and Anna's tender love is undone by the Fugitive Slave Act. H's masculinity and
                                sense of worth are crushed in the convict leasing system, making love feel unreachable.
                                Yet still, love flickers in secret glances, in memories, in survival.
                            </p>
                            <p> Love is often affected by different influences, leading to heartache past trauma can
                                resonate in the current situation. Effia’s relationship reflects how societal
                                expectations can affect love. Today, many families' acceptance leads to heartache
                                decisions. Esi’s forced separation from her lover shows the distraction caused by
                                slavery in personal relationships. Today, due to immigration and systemic racism, it can
                                tear families apart.</p>
                            <p>Throughout the book, Loss is also one of the issues involved in homegoing: loss of
                                freedom, loss of heritage, loss of homeland, and loss of language. All characters in the
                                book carry a burden they did not choose, but they continue forward, by the need to love,
                                to belong, to heal. The loss of home and freedom in every generation through war,
                                colonialism, imprisonment, and racism.
                            </p>
                            <p> When Marjorie and Marcus meet distant cousins from opposite ends of the family, that was
                                the peaceful moment because this moment is involved in reconnection after centuries of
                                pain, showing that when love reaches final peace.
                            </p>
                            <h3>How does the issue resonate with current societal themes? </h3>
                            <p> In the book, we can see that loss is not only about physical absence, it also has
                                emotional and psychological effects on mental health and identity.
                            </p>
                            <p>In today’s world, parents and families demonstrate immense love and support for their
                                kin, when they have a member suffering from an addiction. Parents sacrifice their
                                resources to help their children fight these addictions. In South Africa, for example,
                                the worrying rise in tramadol addiction among youths has left many parents devastated by
                                the loss of their children to overdosing. Parents stand with and support their children
                                through their fight with addiction and more often than not end up losing them.

                        <div class="theme-content">
                            <p>In Homegoing, James and Akosua's story highlights the impact of generational trauma and
                                the struggle for individual agency in the face of societal structures. James, influenced
                                by Akosua's suffering, chooses to leave his family's involvement in the slave trade,
                                demonstrating a shift in perspective and a new path for himself. This choice, while
                                impactful, also underscores the enduring legacy of the past and the challenges of
                                escaping it, even when personal choices are made. The story resonates today by exploring
                                themes of personal choice, systemic oppression, and the ongoing struggle for justice and
                                equality in the face of historical injustices.
                            </p>
                            <p>Abena's story reveals the constraints placed on women in her society, particularly
                                regarding marriage and choices about her future. She faces the expectation of waiting
                                for a husband and the limited options available to her if she does not marry. This
                                resonates with contemporary issues of gender inequality and the limitations placed on
                                women's agency in many societies.
                            </p>
                            <h3>How does the issue resonate with current societal themes? </h3>
                            <p>In USA for example there have been ongoing discussions around reparations for historical
                                injustices such as slavery. These actions could include financial compensation, land
                                redistribution among others. A choice like this by the government reflects the wave of
                                change as the tension between maintaining the status quo or pursuing systemic equality
                                rises.

                        explores how the legacy of slavery and colonialism affects families across time and continents.
                        Through vivid characters and emotional storytelling, the book highlights the deep human need to
                        understand one’s roots and identity. It also shows how history shapes personal and collective
                        experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>Homegoing is a thought-provoking, poignant, and well-written book. It is written in simple prose
                        and is
                        easy to understand.
                        Yaa Gyasi follows the lives of two half-sisters and their generations, who do not know of each
                        other’s
                        existence, beginning in the seventeenth century in present-day Ghana. Gyasi draws a stark
                        contrast
                        between the lives of the two half-sisters, Effia and Esi; the former is married off to a British
                        slaver,
                        while the latter, albeit being the daughter of a big man, is captured as a slave and shipped off
                        to
                        America.</p>

                    <p>Effia’s son, Quey takes over the slave trading from his father and continues this legacy. This
                        practice is broken off by Quey’s son, James, when he decides to leave everything behind and
                        marry
                        the love of his life, a lowly girl from the Asante kingdom, Akosua. From this point in the book,
                        we
                        can see a shift in perspective from the characters, who choose who to marry and marry for love.
                        Education and Christianity are also introduced at this point. James’ granddaughter, Akua,
                        receives
                        some education at a mission school where she is raised. Akua struggles with mental health issues
                        her
                        entire adult life, to the point where she sets her hut ablaze one night during one of her
                        episodes,
                        killing two of her daughters. Her son, Yaw, who survives the massacre, is taken away from her,
                        and
                        she becomes a pariah in the village. Yaw goes on to become a successful history teacher, but
                        struggles with relationships as his face is forever scarred from the night of the fire. He
                        marries
                        in his late fifties.
                    </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, across the Atlantic, Esi’s descendants suffer untold suffering as slaves. From
                        the
                        cotton fields in Mississippi, to the coal mines in Pratt City, to the streets of Harlem, they
                        all
                        bear the brunt of slavery, and they live in fear of being a black person in America after the
                        abolishment of slavery. This feeling is aptly captured by Sonny, Esi’s great-grandson,
                        ”The news made it seem like fault lay with the blacks. The violent, crazy, monstrous black
                        people
                        who had the gall to demand that their children not be gunned down in the streets. ………..in
                        America,
                        the worst thing you could be was a black man. Worse than death. You were a dead man walking.”

                    <p></p>
                    <p>The two lineages are finally united when Marjorie, Yaw’s daughter(from Effia’s lineage), and
                        Marcus,
                        Sonny’s son (from Esi’s line), meet, become friends, and travel to Ghana together from the
                        United
                        States, although they have no idea they come from the same lineage. </p>
                    <p>As readers, we were looking forward to the meeting of the two lineages, but we were disappointed
                        they
                        didn’t realize they were related. We wish we had seen more to it, if we could put it like that.
                    </p>
                    <p>Homegoing is a great read, especially for anyone looking to understand the intricacies of the
                        British
                        invasion of West Africa, colonization, slavery, and the aftermath. Gyasi aptly captures the
                        emotions
                        of the characters, and the reader feels as if they are living through the characters’ lives.
